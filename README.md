 - Works with both light and dark themes using your customized colors for syntax highlighting.
 - Worker thread for rendering
 - Color rendering using intelliJ's tokenizer
 - Scrollable!
 - Embedded into editor window
 - Complete replacement for Code Outline that supports new IntelliJ builds.

Running from source in IntelliJ
===================
1. Make sure you have the Plugin DevKit installed.
2. Checkout sources from github
3. Create a new IntelliJ Platform plugin project
4. Select source directory, chose a plugin sdk (create one that points to your intellij install).
5. Mark src/main/java as source root, and src/test/java as test root.
6. In order to run tests you will need to find mockito and testng jars. I usually do this with gradle.
7. In module settings set the path to META-INF to src/main/resources
8. Hit Run.
